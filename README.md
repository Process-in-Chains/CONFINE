# CONFINE framework
CONFINE is a decentralilzed framework for inter-organizational process mining that leverages trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to preserve data privacy and secrecy. In this repository, you can find the prototype implementation of the framework's main components, namely:

- Provisioner: delivers event log to be mined;
- Secure Miner:  retrieves and merge event log from mutiple provisioners sources to apply process mining algorithms
