# CONFINE framework
CONFINE is a decentralilzed framework for inter-organizational process mining that leverages trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to preserve data privacy and secrecy. In this repository, you can find the prototype implementation of the framework's main components, namely:

- Provisioners: deliver event log to be mined;
- Secure Miners:  retrieve and merge event log from mutiple provisioners sources to apply process mining algorithms
