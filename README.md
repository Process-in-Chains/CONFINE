# CONFINE: Preserving data secrecy in inter-organizational process mining
The CONFINE framework represents a decentralized paradigm for inter-organizational process mining, utilizing trusted applications operating within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to uphold the tenets of data privacy and confidentiality. This repository houses the prototype implementation of the principal components constituting the framework, namely:

Provisioners: HTTP servers responsible for delivering event logs designated for mining.
Secure Miners: EGo Intel SGX trusted applications retrieving and merging event logs to be fed into process mining algorithms.
